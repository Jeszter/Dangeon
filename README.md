**Dungeon** is a small project created using object-oriented programming, where the player controls a knight, battles enemies, and avoids traps in a dungeon.  

### **Game Features**  

**Traps:**  
The player faces deadly mechanisms: spikes, fire traps, arrow droppers, and falling boulders. Each trap is designed to test your reaction and tactical thinking. Spikes and fire deal damage when caught in their animations, arrows cause significant damage, and boulders fall if you get too close.  

**Enemies:**  
The game features a variety of opponents with unique characteristics:  

- **Slimes** attack in close combat.  
- **SkullHeads** chase you and attack with magical blue fire.  
- **Bats**, summoned by the boss, deal damage in close combat.  

Each enemy has its own attack strategy, making every fight unique.  

**Boss:**  
The final challenge is a battle with a mage, who has a massive health pool and can summon allies in critical moments. The camera locks to emphasize the scale of the fight, adding to the epicness of the final showdown.  

**Knight:**  
Your character is a brave knight with 100 HP and a unique ability: a powerful circular attack that deals 50 damage to all nearby enemies. This is a formidable weapon against any threat.  

**Items and Interactive Objects:**  
- Explore the dungeon, find potions to restore health, and keys to unlock the path to the boss.  
- Interact with chests and boxes to obtain valuable items.  

**Game Goal:**  
Make your way through the dangerous dungeon, defeat the enemies, and vanquish the mage to complete your epic journey.
